## Introduction
This empirical research will be looking into how the current account balance and national currencies affect the economic growth of a country and be looking more specifically at the numerous economic shocks that the countries of the United Kingdom and Japan have faced in the past 30 years (1985-2015). A thorough comparison between the two countries of how much certain economic indicators have affected their countries individually and their overall growth journey in that time and to see if there are any insights to be seen in these comparisons. A further analysis of the effect of asymmetric shocks to the two economies will also be compared.  There will be focus on their monetary policies and how a much growth they were able to achieve in that time period, looking at their GDP per capita. This paper will also be exploring some possible weaknesses pointed out by the current literature of the global monetary system, possible factors when it comes to economic growth by looking at different models to attempt to create an economic model to gain insights on the relationship between these variables and economic growth. This is all to see if there are ways for an economy to achieve more consistent economic growth that does not experience as many booms and busts in their growth trajectories. 

### Research Question

Would Stabilizing National Currencies Link to Higher Economic Growth?

### Methodology
I had initially looked into doing a time series analysis of the data using an ARIMA model, including Wold’s decomposition theorem. However, due to me wanting to test many factors to see their effects on economic growth rate per capita it was too difficult to fit it into one model. Even using the Box Jenkins method of producing models and creating differentials for each data point so that the data can be worked together I was unable to find a way to factor in key components such as exchange rate, the structural budget and other variable into the model for me to see how the each variable would interact. I wanted to have the approach of making the data speak for itself no matter the results that came out. The panel data model was more feasible as attempted to reach the conditions for stationary time series of stationary in mean, stationary in variance and stationery in covariance.  I had also tried to use ready available software such as Auto ARIMA to help me find a model that I could work with but it was later shown that the models chosen are not necessary better than what a human could produce. 
I also considered using a AR model as they are from within the same class of models (in one sense they share the same degree of complexity. With the approach in mind the principle of parsimony but even going for a parsimonious model, I could not make the data work. I had therefore chosen to us panel data for my research. Some of the advantages that I had taken into consideration rather than using time series data was that heterogeneity would not have been observable with time series, with panel data I can explicitly take them into account by allowing subject specific variables. Also, from the more obvious reason that with panel data it gives more informative data and more variability. Furthermore, panel data is better at measuring the effects of dynamic change such as the effects of crashes and the waves of increases and decreases of economic growth indicators.  I will be looking at the period between 1985 until 2015. This is shortly after the fall of the Bretton woods system and I believe the data up until 2015 is reliable and can be used for analysis. Furthermore, the number of time observations is large compared to the small number of cross-sectional data is small making it so that there is little difference in the value of the parameters estimated by random effects models and fixed effects model. I decided to rely on computational convenience because of this and limited time and ran a pooled OLS regression. 

### Country Selection and Data Source
My plan was to compare the two countries of the United Kingdom and Japan. In terms of their GDP per capita and how sensitive their economies are to current account and exchange rate shocks. I have chosen the G7 countries of the UK and Japan as they use to be the G5 of finance ministers that would come to discuss monetary policies, including fixed exchange rate models. They are all developed countries with ready available macro data (Hajnal, 2019). Whenever possible I will choose to gather data from the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Data at these organizations is trusted and they are consistent in their measurements. This is also to avoid any inconsistencies in measurement in each country personal data sources and to help eliminate endogenous bias in my data from countries trying to pain their data in a more favourable light. These countries were also chosen because a paper from the European central bank had factored in market forces and concluded that 80% of the time the G7 countries were successful in their polices on the G3 currencies and their policy makers but it was only effective for the 3 months of the initial shift in policy. The G3 currencies being the Japanese Yen, European Euro and the United States Dollar.  It was also said that when G7 countries did not play a role in controlling the currency the currencies would sometimes come out of desired alignment (Fratzscher,2010). The data itself will be gathered from the IMF as they are a trusted international organisation with consistent measurement across all countries. This was chosen over domestic data as there could be bias in the data. Lastly, there is a large amount of data from both these countries in the IMF. 


### Empirical Results
I ran a pooled OLS with lag independent variables to solve for the autoregression problem. My first model I had put all my independant variables to a lag of 1. I came up with some interesting results. I later decided to run a robust regression to lower the influence of any outliers in my data and resulted in a higher R-squared value.

### Test for Heteroskedasticity & Normality

When testing for heteroskedasticity, the model got a 0.8284. I reject the null hypothesis making my data homoscedastic. The variance in my data is around the same finite value allowing me to move on with my data. I got a .6697, I reject the null hypothesis, making my data normal. I tested for normality to see if my data set is well modelled by a normal distribution and to check if to see if any of the random variables underlying the data set are normally distributed. It is the random error in the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable in a regression model.

### Looking at GDP per Capita for Each Country

(Y-axis in millions, International Monetary Fund, 2021)
Even with the UK’s population steadily increasing. The GDP per capita has increased by 373.87% in the past 30 years with only a small dip in 2008. The Japanese has had growth in GDP per capita of 198.52% over the past 30 years. With a population on the slow decline in past few years. The UK outperformed Japan in terms of growth by 175.35%. Even with its larger initial population of 121 million compared to the UK’s 56 million.

### Discussion
To fulfil my initial aim of finding out if having more stable currency will lead to more stable economic growth, I believe I have come closer to that question but is still too presumptuous to conclude as of now. As I was able to compare two developed countries with different economic policies for their growth strategies as the data suggests in the current account deficit. A more in-depth research looking at more dependant variables and a larger range of countries would result in a more accurate statement but for the limitations of time this study has produced some interesting results. Both countries have produced a large amount of growth to GDP per capita for its citizens. With both increasing it by triple if not more in the past 30 years. With the UK experiencing a more stable rise as Japan was in contact with many financial crashes and natural disasters compared to the UK. Furthermore, Japan has also shown a larger variance in its exchange rates. However, from the model produced Japan experiences less affects to changes in their exchange rate, making them more capable of handling sudden changes in exchange rates.  So to summaries the UK has seen less volatility over the years while Japan has had much more volatility from outside sources but Japan has shown to being able to handle changes better than the UK. Therefore, the UK with more stable variables have seen the most growth in GDP per capita even with a rise in population and a rise in the population increase rate. Thus, it would be suggested that having a more stable currency would lead to more growth even though the UK is more sensitive to currency shocks, if there is such a low risk of there being a shock to their currency (such as a currency crisis) it would be ok to take on more policies that do not have the currency account deficit and the exchange rate as a high priority on the list as economic indicators to monitor. Showing evidence of this as the current account deficit only seems to grow as the UK economy grows. Perhaps suggesting that the UK worries less about its exchange rates and current account deficit. 
After the initial fall in exchange rate of USD/YEN in 1988 there has been a period of more stability for the currency but for the Japanese economy there seems to be, looking at the data a shock to their economy every 3-5 years that leads the economy back into a recession when they had only just recently recovered from it. With the current account deficit experiencing booms and busts along with the economy. They are less sensitive to shocks as the data suggests but also showcased in the 1997 Asian currency crash as Japan was one of the effected economies but was able to recover quickly from the shock. Also, how even though there were huge fluctuations in the Yen in 1985 and 1986 the Japanese economy was still able to grow in those years. However, they did produce much less growth compared to the UK. This I would argue was due to other shocks rather than anything to do with the nation’s currency. Therefore, trying to isolate the effects of Japans currency fluctuations in their economy is difficult as even though they have a more active approach of managing their exchange rates and having a positive current account deficit they have experienced less growth due to other factors. It could be argued from the previous conclusion that Japan’s economy might have been even worse if they did not have these policies. For example, the currency crisis of 1997 could have been much worse if not for the Japanese governments approach to their national currency.  From this the focus of economies would be to have an approach that would limit large fluctuations in their current account balance and their exchange rates themselves as even if as an economy you are able to handle the shocks better than other countries if a country is able to have a period of stability, that type of environment looks to be more conducive to growth. As shown with the UK having more stable growth dealing with less shocks than Japan that has had less growth due to the many shocks they experienced. Lastly, further research would be required to come to a more decisive conclusion with more countries, more variables to account for economic growth and using more complex models to have a more precise and reliable conclusion.




## Conclusion
To conclude, this research was based on the interest of seeing if there are any growth benefits to an economy if there is a higher degree of control over a nations currency through fiscal and monetary policy. The current literature is quick to point out the flaws of national and international monetary policy on national currencies. They also offer solutions to the issue by suggesting the formation of a more formalized international monetary union with the required infrastructure to enact policies of a more global scale to reinforce the structural stability of the worlds monetary system. With even further suggestions to enact a form of global currency that is not tied down the influences of nations domestic issues but is treated as a backer to all currencies and a medium of exchange. From my model, it was not able to include every variable that was initially planned for due to time constraints and due to the complex nature of a nation’s economy. However, there was interesting insights to be gained from the data analysis. It was shown that even though the Japanese economy was less sensitive to fluctuations in their national currency as compared to the UK. Japan has faced a larger amount volatility in their growth with Japan falling into recession quiet frequently when compared to the UK. This has led to the conclusion that economies would have to have an approach that would limit large fluctuations in their current account balance and their exchange rates themselves rather than a having a policy that can absorb the shocks. A preventative measure to keep exchange rates and current account balance from being overly volatile seems more beneficial for growth in the long term.
